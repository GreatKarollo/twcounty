\caption{A summary of 15 of the 80 lexical categories. These were selected by collecting all categories that are significantly correlated with at least two outcomes after controlling for demographics variables ($p < 0.05$, Bonferroni-corrected). We list the significantly correlated outcomes, the sign of correlation, and the field where the word was found: {\sl t} for text and {\sl d} for user description.  E.g., the second row indicates that the presence of a word from the Family category in a user description is positively correlated with teen birth rates. {\label{tab.lexicon2}}}
